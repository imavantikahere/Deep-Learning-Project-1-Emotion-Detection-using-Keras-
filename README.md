# Deep-Learning-Project-1-Emotion-Detection-using-Keras-
This project uses keras in python to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model that detects the emotions portrayed by various profile photos of humans. It uses the dataset provided by kaggle.com. This dataset was prepared by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, as part of an ongoing research project. Some of the code I have used for this project was derived from https://sefiks.com/2018/01/01/facial-expression-recognition-with-keras/, to understand the notion of CNN, and to get an idea about some common syntax.

Note that my training accuracy is 58%, and testing accuracy is 52%, which may not seem like a lot, but the winner on kaggle.com's official competition for this very project had an accuracy of 34% (according to https://sefiks.com/2018/01/01/facial-expression-recognition-with-keras/), and those who later tried it  have accuracies of about 57%, so mine is a safe middle ground. It's a starting point :) Furthermore, increasing number of epochs greatly increases accuracy, so for greater accuracies, set number of epochs to 30-40. My CPU was not able to sustain higher levels of processing so I left it at 35 epochs, which gived fairly accurate results.
