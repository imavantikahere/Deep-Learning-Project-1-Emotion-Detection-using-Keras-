# Deep-Learning-Project-1-Emotion-Detection-using-Keras-
This project uses keras in python to build a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) model that detects the emotions portrayed by various profile photos of humans. It uses the dataset provided by kaggle.com. This dataset was prepared by Pierre-Luc Carrier and Aaron Courville, as part of an ongoing research project. Some of the code I have used for this project was influenced by https://sefiks.com/2018/01/01/facial-expression-recognition-with-keras/, to understand the notion of CNN, and to get an idea about some common syntax.
